# GuessingGame
I have implement a word-guessing game with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Here, i have also provided a hint key & accept only a single letter as an input for each time to guess the correct word. If it is correct, then that letter will fill in that specific blank space, otherwise, the guessing will be continued, accordingly.
